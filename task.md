# Timeline 
2026-02-18 afternoon: dry test

2026-02-19: final measurement

# TODO
## µC-Code
### Establish Network [Thomas, Cedric]
- [x] fix memory leak
- [x] set transmission power
- [x] RSSI use correct conn handle
- [x] RGB LED to identify node
- [x] NODE_COUNT make variable

### Collect Datapoints [Justus]
write easily deployable version

## Data Collection
can we use 5 nodes

Design expriments to find maximum radio range

Trial run in APB
- dry testing → everything should be implemented
- we do not want to fix issues outside in the cold

Final collection
- 5 envs * (30 min/env measurement + 15 min/env setup) = 3h 45 min
- location: Großer Garten + Elbe
	- chosen due to relative proximity of all relevant environments


## ML Analysis [Teoman, Robert]
[CNN] finalize data splitting

ResNet
